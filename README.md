## I. THE TREE GATEWAY
This is the sovereign source for all topological definitions and hierarchical protocols within the RADRILONIUMA ecosystem. It is the universal entry point (/tree) for the branching logic of our world.

## II. FUNCTION
Vrela provides the "Branching." It ensures that every new sprout in the Forest follows the fractal laws of the Ark. It defines the paths through which the flow of Luvia and the components of Melia are organized.

*Through Branching, we cover the Earth.*
